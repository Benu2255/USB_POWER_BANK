# USB Power Bank PCB

This repository contains the schematic and PCB design of a compact dual-port USB power bank developed in EasyEDA. The design supports a Li-ion battery and provides regulated 5V output for charging USB-powered devices.

## Features
- USB Type-A output port  
- USB Type-C input/output port  
- Single-cell Li-ion battery support (3.0V–4.2V)  
- 5V DC-DC boost converter (ESOP-8 package)  
- LED indicators for power/status  
- Push-button control  
- Compact, portable PCB layout  

## Tools Used
- EasyEDA (Schematic capture & PCB layout)

## Repository Contents
- Schematic files  
- PCB layout  
- Gerber files for fabrication  
- BOM (Bill of Materials)

## How It Works
The Li-ion battery is charged through the USB input. A DC-DC boost converter steps up the battery voltage to a stable 5V for the USB output. Status LEDs and a push button provide basic user interaction.

## Safety Notice
This project is intended for educational and prototyping purposes. Li-ion batteries must be handled with proper charging, protection circuitry, and safety precautions. Do not use in commercial products without thorough testing and certification.

## Future Improvements
- Fast charging support (QC/PD)  
- Battery percentage indicator (LED/OLED)  
- Improved efficiency and thermal performance
